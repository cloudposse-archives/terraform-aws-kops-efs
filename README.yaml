# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an IAM role for `efs-provider` running in a Kops cluster, and attach an IAM policy to the role with permissions to mount/modify EFS.


  ## Overview

  This module assumes you are running [efs-provider](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/aws/efs) in a Kops cluster.

  It will provision an IAM role with the required permissions and grant the Kops pods the permission to assume it.

  This is useful to mount EFS targets into running Kubernetes pods.

  The module uses [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) to lookup resources within a Kops cluster for easier integration with Terraform.
